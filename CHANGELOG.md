# Changelog

## 3.2.1
 * Fixed default `yum_repo` key in `php::repo::redhat`
 * On Ubuntu precise we now use the ondrej/php5-oldstable ppa. This can be
   manually enabled with by setting `$php::repo::ubuntu::oldstable` to
   `true`.
 * `$php::ensure` now defaults to `present` instead of `latest`. Though,
   strictly speaking, this represents a functional change, we consider this
   to be a bugfix because automatic updates should be enabled explicitely.
 * `$php::ensure` is not anymore passed to `php::extension` resources as
   default ensure parameter because this doesn't make sense.

## 3.2.0
 * Support for FreeBSD added by Frank Wall
 * RedHat now uses remi-php56 yum repo by default
 * The resource `php::fpm::pool` is now public, you can use it in your
   manifests without using `$php::fpm::pools`
 * We now have autogenerated documentation using `puppetlabs/strings`

## 3.1.0
 * New parameter `pool_purge` for `php::extension` to remove files not
   managed by puppet from the pool directory.
 * The `pecl_source` parameter for `php::extension` was renamend to
   `source` because it is also useful for PEAR extensions.
   `pecl_source` can still be used but is deprecated and will be
   removed in the next major release.
 * Parameters referring to time in `php::fpm::config` can now be
   specified with units (i.e. `'60s'`, `'1d'`):
   * `emergency_restart_threshold`
   * `emergency_restart_interval`
   * `process_control_timeout`
 * The PEAR version is not independant of `$php::ensure` and can be
   configured with `$php::pear_ensure`
 * Give special thanks to the contributors of this release:
   * Petr Sedlacek
   * Sherlan Moriah

   are installed prefixed by `php::package_prefix`.
 * PHPUnit is now installed as phar in the same way composer is installed,
   causing all parameters to change
